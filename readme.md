# Custom keyboard configurations

## ZSA Moonlander
My latest ZSA keyboard configuration is using my variation of the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) keyboard layout. The only significant change I have made so far is to change ' with ; on the base layout. Because I write enough code and need to use semi colon all the time, it made sense to keep it on the base layer.

## Void 40
Void 40 was the first handwired keyboard that I built, and it was more of an experiment than anything else. I recently busted the micro controller on this one while trying to fix some sotter joints on the switches, so this one is out of commission and I might not end up fixing this one.

I built this with a 3d printed case, and Glorious Panda switches, with a QMK configuration.

## Dactyl Manuform 5x6
My second hand wired keyboard, and it's a split 5x6 Dactyl Manuform. This keyboard has been my daily driver for over a year now, and I find the comfort to be top notch and the concavity allows my fingers to travel less than on the Moonlander.

I built this with a 3d printed case, and Akko Lavender Switches (My current favorite switches to use), with a QMK configuration.
